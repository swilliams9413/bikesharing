### Trips By Weekday For Each Hour<br>
In this visualization, I graphed the number of bike trips by weekday for each hour of the day as a heatmap.  The weekdays show us two peak times - first between 7 AM - 9 AM, then between 5 PM - 6 PM.<br>

### Trips By Gender (Weekday Per Hour)<br>
In this visualization, I graphed the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week as a heatmap.  The darker read indicates a high saturation - Males are really using the bikes between 5 PM - 6 PM during the week.<br>
